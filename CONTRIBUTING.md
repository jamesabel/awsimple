### Dev setup

Requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher

Fork the repo, to make your own personal copy, and then git clone your fork onto your computer.

Once you have that, install project dependencies with:

#### Mac / Linux
```
source make_venv_dev.sh
./venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```
make_venv_dev.bat
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

At this point you should be able to make changes to the codebase and run things.
